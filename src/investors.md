# Investors / VC Consulting

I support investors and advisory teams with toxicology- and safety-focused scientific diligence.

## Typical questions I help answer
- What are the key safety liabilities or unknowns in this program?
- What studies or data would de-risk the next inflection point?
- How should risk be framed for an IC memo or partner discussion?
- Where are the likely regulatory or evidence “gotchas”?

## Common deliverables
- Rapid readout of a deck, paper, or briefing package
- Diligence memo (risks, key questions, recommended next steps)
- Expert call participation (high-level, non-confidential)

## To engage
