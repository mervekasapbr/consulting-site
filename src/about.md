# About

I provide pharmacology- and toxicology-focused consulting for investors and legal teams, translating complex scientific evidence into decision-ready risk framing.

## Focus areas
- Safety and toxicology interpretation (what results can and cannot support)
- Pharmacology mechanisms and clinical plausibility (dose, timing, co-exposures)
- Pharmaceutical risk assessment and uncertainty framing for high-stakes decisions
- Regulatory pathway advisory, including accelerated approval considerations
- Submission strategy support (NDA/BLA framing and evidence expectations)
- Clinical research and trial design review (feasibility, endpoints, risk)

## Working style
Engagements are scoped, time-bounded, and focused on clear deliverables. Opinions are offered in an independent capacity and do not represent the views of the U.S. government or any agency.
