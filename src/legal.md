# Legal / Toxicology Consulting

I support attorneys and legal teams with toxicology interpretation and scientific framing.

## Typical questions I help answer
- What can (and cannot) be concluded from toxicology results?
- How do timing, dose, and co-exposures affect interpretation?
- What uncertainties and alternative explanations should be considered?
- How should findings be communicated clearly to a non-scientific audience?

## Common deliverables
- Review of reports, lab results, and supporting literature
- Written scientific summary (scope-defined)
- Consultation to help shape questions for deposition/expert review

## Important note
I do not provide legal advice. Engagements are scoped to scientific and technical interpretation.
